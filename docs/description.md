# WambaX
**Legacy style of fast and useful interface**.


## 🚩 Intro
A long time ago, it was a full **Window Manager** project for **X**.  
Now just try to stylish existing **WM**.  


## 📋 Glossary
 - **WM**  
	**Window Manager** are system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows.
 - **X**  
	Is a window manager mainly used on Unix-like systems.


## ℹ️ Description
 - Of course we want WM to look pretty.
 - But the most important is to have an easy to use WM.
 - Minimizing the time for learn and figure how to handle it.
 - And keeping the system fast by not including to much fancy stuff.


## 📝 Note
 - currently only xfwm4 is supported.  
	Expect more in the future.
 - elements show their current state rather than future state,  
	(ex: if you see a button with a lock icon, it means that current state is lock, and not that it will become lock if you click on it).
